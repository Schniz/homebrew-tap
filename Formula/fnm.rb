    <<~CAVEATS
      Thanks for installing fnm!
      The last step for making fnm work is to run it on the shell startup, using the `fnm env` command.

      In order to complete the installation, please add the following to your shell profile:

        # fnm
        #{source_for_shell}

      Homebrew tells us that #{preferred} is your preferred shell,
      and your shell profile is at #{shell_profile.inspect}, if that helps ðŸ˜‡

      > btw, if you know how to make this process automated, help us out with a PR!
      > the code is here: https://github.com/Schniz/homebrew-tap/blob/master/Formula/fnm.rb
    CAVEATS
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/fnm", "--version"
  end

  def source_for_shell
    if preferred == :fish
      "fnm env | source"
    else
      'eval "$(fnm env)"'
    end
  end
end
